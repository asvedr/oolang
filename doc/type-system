primes types:
	int
	real
	char
	bool
GC not used for primes

class types:
	- str
	- [type] - (array of 'type')
	- Asc<key,val> - hash map 
	- user defined classes 'A'
	- user defined templates classes 'A<P1,P2...>
GC used for classes

using coersing:
	obj.call() as Type

coersing with transmutation:
int to str
int to real
int to bool
real to int
real to str
int to bool
bool to int
str to int
str to real
str to bool

all other coersing just change value in type check system
